# Dotfiles
My configuration dotfiles

Requires oh-my-zsh to work correctly.

Also requires powerline fonts for the vimrc and zshrc to work correctly

I'm currently working on a setup script for both zsh and vim, however this is a work in progress and if you value your shell/vim working properly, use with caution.

If you don't have zsh on your machine this takes care of it all for you.
